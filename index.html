        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My first work experience was at a Stater Brothers in my hometown. It was a temporary job since the market needed help during the shortage of supplies in the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown. There were long lines and people were very grumpy about the restrictions of food or toilet paper. I helped by bagging and cleaning the store. I had to learn what products needed to go in what bag together. At first, I was slow packing the bags, but at the end of the day, I felt that I got a lot faster. Since this was my first job, I was exhausted after my shift ended.  I also helped clean the carts. I would go out and look for carts and put them in a line and take them back to the store area for the carts. I liked taking the cart duty since I was able to relax from the rush of customers.  I had to quit because my parents were worried that being in a place that served so many people was too unsafe. This was during the time before we had to wear face masks. Over all I felt that my first job was a good experience.<br>

        Around in July in 2020, I was able to work at a small sandwich shop. It was a small business with around 10 people working in the company. It was a different way of structure from the Stater Brothers since it was a much smaller company. It only had the owner and a manager. It is a family owned business and they taught me experience on how to treat others in a small business workspace.  I worked as a cashier and helped close up the shop. I typically worked 4 days a week including saturdays. I had to learn a lot of new things, but it was worth it since I gained experience in working at the small business. I learned how to use their cash register and use the different food delivery apps. I also learned to make the sandwiches and wrap the sandwiches in paper. At the end of the day, I would clean the store and help the owner close the shop.
<br><br>

        In May of 2019, I began to volunteer at my church’s coffee shop. It has a whole building with everything you would see at a real small business coffee shop. The only difference was that we were volunteers not employees.  We sold everything such as lattes and frappuccinos. We also sold pastries made by the church members. The cookies were the favorites since the cookies were only 50 cents. The whole menu was very cheap because the church only wanted to break even from the profits. If there was ever a guest that came to the coffee shop, we would give them a free drink. It would convince them to stay in the plaza and get to learn other people.  We would typically have a large rush when the service ended and then when nearly everyone left, we would clean up and go home.  This opportunity helped me because it helped me learn to interact with the customers and handle the cashier position. It learned how to make drinks for the customers. I loved the job and it helped me with my future jobs.
